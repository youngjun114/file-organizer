### Description

This simple project building file organizer with **Node.JS**

When importing media files from smartphone to desktop or mac, such as images, screenshots, and videos, you will have .mov, .mp4, .png, .aae, and etc.
In this specific project, I wanted followings:

- Video files move to **_video folder_**
- Screenshots such as .png and .aae move to **_captured folder_**
- Image files that are edited have format of "IMG_EXXX", and original image files have format of "IMG_XXX". In this project, I wanted original images to move into **_duplicated folder_**
